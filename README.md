📊 Student Performance Analysis

This project analyzes student performance data to identify key factors that influence academic outcomes. Using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** with Python, we uncover patterns and insights that can help in improving education strategies and student support.

📁 Project Structure

- `Student Performance.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing the data analysis process.
- `data/`: Folder (not included here) where the dataset should be placed.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

📌 Objectives

- Perform comprehensive EDA on student performance dataset.
- Visualize patterns and correlations between various factors like gender, study time, parental education, etc.
- Draw meaningful conclusions to support data-driven educational strategies.

🧰 Tools & Technologies

  - Python
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - Jupyter Notebook
- **Dataset Source**: [Kaggle - Student Performance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams)

🧪 Key Features

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Univariate and Bivariate Analysis
- Correlation Matrix and Heatmaps
- Group-wise Comparisons (e.g., gender vs score, parental education vs performance)
- Insights and Recommendations

🖼️ Sample Visualizations

- Bar plots showing score distribution by gender
- Heatmap showing correlations between exam scores
- Box plots comparing parental education level and average marks

📊 Insights Summary

- Students with more study time and better parental education tend to perform better.
- Gender-based trends show minor variations in subject-wise performance.
- Test preparation course completion significantly improves scores.

🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Place the dataset (CSV) into the `data/` directory.
